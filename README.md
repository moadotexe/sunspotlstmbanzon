SUNSPOT PREDICTION USING AN LSTM. 

About
Sunspots are phenomena seen on the sun's surface that are darker than the rest of the surface and represent a flux in the Sun's magnetic field. Although rare, these spots can help in determining the general activity of the sun and in effect how space is affected. The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to predict the possibility of sunspots occurring using a data set of sunspot activity and train a neural network based on the data. The neural network's purpose is to aid in predicting future sunspots.
